"Doom is a 1993 first-person shooter game developed by id Software for MS-DOS. Players assume the role of a space marine, popularly known as Doomguy, fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell." - Wikipedia

Doom for Windows 95 is also included on this page, and is recommended if you'd like to run this as a native application without using unofficial means.
Notes
THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL RELEASE. This is a source port called Boom that makes the game run faster on slower hardware, namely Chromebooks or computers somehow still running Windows 95. I did everything I could to make it as fast as possible, and unlike most (if not all) other versions of the game on Internet Archive, this actually runs really well on my home computer. I can't say much for Chromebooks as my school has blocked this site so that testing goes to the players. If you know of any other ways to speed the game up, please let me know by sending a review, and I'll make the change as soon as I can. I also don't recommend changing any in-game settings, as I tested them myself.

If you're looking for the IWAD though (the actual game data used for other source ports and the original game), you've come to the right place.
